\title{Get the cluster membership of each trajectory}
\usage{
\S4method{clusterAssignments}{lcModel}(object, strategy = which.max, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The \code{lcModel} to obtain the cluster assignments from.}

\item{strategy}{A function returning the cluster index based on the given vector of membership probabilities. By default, ids are assigned to the cluster with the highest probability.}

\item{...}{Any additional arguments passed to the strategy function.}
}
\description{
Get the cluster membership of each trajectory
}
\details{
While the default strategy is \link{which.max}, it is recommended to use \link[nnet]{which.is.max} instead, as this function breaks ties randomly.
Another strategy to consider is the function \link{which.weight}, which enables weighted sampling of cluster assignments.
}
\examples{
data(latrendData)
model <- latrend(method = lcMethodKML("Y", id = "Id", time = "Time"), latrendData)
clusterAssignments(model)

# only assign ids with a probability over 0.9
clusterAssignments(model, strategy = function(x) which(x > .9)[1])
}
